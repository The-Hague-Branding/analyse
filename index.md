                Who is the city designed and marketed for? Who really makes the city? And who does the City of The Hague wants?  </p>
                <p> This project analyses the language used in the “Approach to City Branding in The Hague in 2020” document and looks at what type of individuals are being addressed. We ultimately aim to reflect on whether a city is made of a diverse community of individuals or rather only made for those who can offer the most.  </p>
                <p>With the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in mind, we aim to represent the contrast between the ideal image the city works towards, by contrasting it with the list of critical professions that were recently published by the government amidst the pandemic crisis. These professions are: <i>social and day care workers, educational staff, public transport workers, food supply industry professions, such as supermarket workers, processing industry and the transports of this industry, such as collection of products from farmers, the delivery, the access of workers to the harvest, logistical professions i.e. for transport of fuels, waste collectors, media broadcasters, emergency service workers such as fire services, ambulance care, GHOR, crisis management of the security regions, cleaning services, central government workers i.e. central government, provinces, municipalities, those in charge of payment of benefits and surcharges, civil affairs, consulates and embassies, judicial institutions and forensic clinics.</i> </p>
                <p>These are the fundamental professions to keep society running.
                If a city is designed to attract only desired target groups, can we still consider it being equally designed for the ones that don’t match the target criteria?</p>

  <h2><span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> HAGUE CITY <span class="ti-lang-strat">BRANDING</span> 2020</h2> 
<h3>1. Summary</h3>
The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is the starting point for what we will be doing in city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in the coming years. That is why a lot of <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span> has been paid to a good and pragmatic <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> definition. <span class="ti-key-high">Under the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague we mean the distinctive, <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> and credible presentation of the city’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. The city <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is therefore much more than a slogan or logo. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague forms the basis for what we will do together to improve the image of The Hague and make the city even more <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span>. </span>

To give our <span class="tourists-item img-ov"><sup class="image1"></sup>activities</span> direction and <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span>, we use the <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague five elements: the main elements of the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item img-ov"><sup class="image2"></sup>international</span></span></span> City of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item img-ov"><sup class="image3"></sup>Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item img-ov"><sup class="image4"></sup>Justice</span> and the City by the <span class="tourists-item img-ov"><sup class="image5"></sup>sea</span>, and the supporting elements Government Center, Leading <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item img-ov"><sup class="image6"></sup>companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span> and <span class="tourists-item">Royal</span> residence. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague, the elements and all differentiations are recorded in a ‘<span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book of the City of The Hague’. This <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book is currently being developed in collaboration with partners and will eventually be published in a digital form. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book is not only intended as a framework for the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of The Hague, but also as an inspiring as well as an open-source toolkit with practical <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> such as key messages, facts and figures, photos and videos. 
The <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> for The Hague creates a number of challenges for the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague. Not only to promote The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> as a city to the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> in the coming years, but also to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the city’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> so that it is even more in line with the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. This <span class="ti-lang-strat">Strengthening</span> of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> part of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. <span class="ti-key-high">
    An essential starting point of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague is that it concerns the entire city. The city is made by everyone who has settled here. For a successful city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> that everyone contributes and proudly promotes The Hague and provides a <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of the city.</span> That is why this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> was developed after extensive cooperation with residents of The Hague and representatives of <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">entrepreneurs</span></span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="business-item">investors</span></span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span>. An essential part of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague is that we measure whether what we do has a desired result. Not only to be <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> and transparent about our effectiveness, but also to fine-tune our <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> and further <span class="ti-lang-strat">develop</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> and <span class="tourists-item">activities</span>. The action plans will set <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> for each coalition which shows a realistic and verifiable <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> to promote and <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> the Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">strength</span>. In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span> to these <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> can also for <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> and <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> are identified. <span class="ti-key-high">The <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> that we primarily <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on with the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of The Hague can be distinguished between persons such as <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span>, and clusters such as <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span></span> and <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item">conferences</span></span>. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> focuses on the ‘mindset’ of obtaining the aforementioned <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>, and ultimately increasing the realisation of these <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> in the city. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> that we will implement can only succeed if there is a common responsibility and commitment from the city.</span> We are therefore building on the partnerships that have been formed in the context of the City <span class="ti-lang-strat">Marketing</span> Vision 2011-2015 and will further expand, supplement and intensify these into decisive coalitions aimed at <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague for<span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. An action plan will be made for each coalition with <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="tourists-item">activities</span>. Work where coalitions and utilisations of each other’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> is possible. They are the carriers of The story of The Hague and only they can <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> tell why others must also choose The Hague, based on their <span class="ti-lang-tone">pride</span>. We let people, <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span> from the city express why the city is so <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> to them. And we deploy <span class="ti-lang-strat">targeted</span> communication campaigns to make The Hague appear on the map, especially among the <span class="young-prof-item">younger</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. Research shows that a lot them do not know at all about The Hague, and they often have much more <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> attitude towards the city when they are familiar with what it has to offer. The same applies to <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> statement. We will do everything we can to ensure that the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> will get to know The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span>, and especially the less explored sides of the city. This <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> means a change from the older perspective. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague has been defined even more sharply. Currently, its central <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> will not only be focusing on <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span>, but also on <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> it. To make the impact of our <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> as effective as possible, we are going to maintain strict direction in a consistent manner. This not only regards the demands on the partnership in which we, as a city work together on the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>, but also on the administrative and official embedding of city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> within the municipal organisation. It is investigated how the involved municipal administrators, programs and components are <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> streamlined, where and which tasks can <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> be invested, and the roles and competencies required.
Obviously, it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> to gain insight into the achievement of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> of  The Hague City <span class="ti-lang-strat">Branding</span> and being <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> and transparent about it. That is why within our coalitions we will formulate <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> in action plans that are drawn up. These goals can relate to matters related to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague as well as the <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> we want to achieve in <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span>. We will share our <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> to <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> evaluating both the <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> and the image of the city. We will communicate this account to each other and use the <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> to refine our <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span>. 

<h3>2. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague</h3> 

The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> is the starting point for what we will be doing in city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in the coming years. That is why a lot of <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span> has been paid to a good and pragmatic <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> definition. Under the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague we understand the distinctive, <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> and credible proposal of the city to attract and retain <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. The city <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is therefore much more than one slogan or logo. The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> forms the basis for what we will do together for the image of The Hague and make the city even more <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span>. That is why the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague has strong direction and control, therefore this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> outlines the frameworks for this. 

<h4>What is a city <span class="strategy">brand</span></h4>

A city is not an ambiguous product with an owner and a only one <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> group. A city has a multitude of faces, therefore it has countless <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> and exists by the grace of it history, culture and people who make it. A city’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is a powerful proposal and it is defined within these complex circumstances. A proposal with a function towards the outside world (what makes the city worth choosing) and a function for the <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of the city (to ensure that promises can be made redeemed). <span class="ti-key-high">A city <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is much more than a slogan or logo and requires sharp choices. A city <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> that is clearly and purposefully defined can consciously choose <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> to opt for the city and clearly guides the <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of the city.</span> 

<h4>From city <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> to city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span></h4>

As a city, we will continue to <span class="ti-lang-strat">develop</span> from city <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> to city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. It seems perhaps like only a slight difference in word usage, but it is much more than that. 

<h3>Value</h3>
 In recent years, the <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> has been on the implementation of a <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> plan with demarcated <span class="tourists-item">activities</span>, the Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> will become a more strategic function in the coming years and have a wider impact. The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> is more than before in all of its facets and will be central to our <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> to enhance the image, how it can positively influence the city and make it more <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> for the chosen <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="events-item">audiences</span>. In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span> to our <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> to help spread the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> see what it makes of The Hague to the outside world, we pay more <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span> to it <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span>. For <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> projects, plans or <span class="ti-lang-strat">developments</span>s in the city we will expressly check whether this fits in with the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. We are going to make sure that The Hague is <span class="ti-lang-strat">developing</span> in a direction that matches the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> of The Hague. We do all this even more intensively together as a city.

<h4>The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> explained</h4>

<span class="ti-key-high">The Hague has so many features and facilities that can speak of its <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> that it is difficult to list them all in one description. Only by making clear choices about what makes The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> optimally contributes to the <span class="targets">profile</span> of the city.</span> The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> contains elements that meet the following conditions:

 • Distinctive from other cities: Elements such as clean, safe, diverse and hospitable are hardly used in <span class="ti-lang-strat">brands</span> of other cities. 

• <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> and credible: The <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> elements must clearly fit the city and can be sufficiently managed. 

• Appealing to the primary <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> and addressing several of them. 

• Ambitious and motivating: <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> elements may outline a future perspective which also inspires, challenges and encourages the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span>. 

<h4>Main elements </h4>

After extensive consultations with stakeholders, the main elements for the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> of city of The Hague were decided. <span class="ti-key-high">The starting point was not to reduce the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague to one sentence. This is too short for The Hague and it is impossible to identify all <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> features that appeal to the city’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. At the same time, it is also not possible to list everything that makes the city of The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> to showcase. After all, this mainly leads to confusion with the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="events-item">audiences</span>. After all, choices had to be made. What does The Hague showcase? What are the elements of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague that deserve a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span>?</span> The core of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague consists of two main elements. The Hague has been positioning itself for years as the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> City of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span>. There is a lot of <span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span> both within and outside the municipality to continue with this image. The second main element is City by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> . The location by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> is a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> quality The Hague. Together, the two main elements form the core of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague and are explained below. 

<h4><span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> City of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span></h4>

The position of the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> City of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span> has been uncontested for years. The history of The Hague goes back to the first <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> Conference in 1899. In this case The City of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span> has put The Hague on the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> map, and for many <span class="events-item">organisations</span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span>, knowledge <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span>, <span class="students-item">students</span> and congresses is an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> reason to visit. <span class="ti-key-high">It gives the city an <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> image, with a great diversity of <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> residents.</span> The Hague has the presence of the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> Court of <span class="events-item">Justice</span> and it constitutes a UN City. The Hague is <span class="tourists-item">international</span>ly recognised with <span class="events-item">justice</span> and hope for <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">peace</span></span>. <span class="ti-key-high">The position has a very <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> effect on the image of the city. This is where everyone works on a <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span>, safer and fairer World.</span> This is the place to be if you want to play an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> role on the world stage. The Hague is increasingly becoming a unique meeting and a place of cooperation for government leaders, judges, knowledge <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span>, social organizations, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">business</span></span> and <span class="students-item">students</span>. 

<h4>City by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span></h4>

The location by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> makes The Hague unique. No other major Dutch City has the combination of eleven kilometres of coast, a thriving <span class="tourists-item">sea</span>side resort and a historic city center so close each other. Even <span class="tourists-item">international</span>ly this is quite <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>. <span class="ti-key-high">It gives the city a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> dynamic that many residents, <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span>, <span class="students-item">students</span> and employees of <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span> are very appealed by.</span> There are many opportunities to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> this position. <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span> is still not enough recognised as to be linked to The Hague and <span class="tourists-item">international</span>ly, the fact that The Hague has a <span class="tourists-item">beach</span> should be promoted even stronger. In the communication about <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span> we enter into the relationship with The Hague, we even speak of ‘The Hague <span class="tourists-item">beach</span>’ rather than <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span>. 

<h4><span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span>ing elements</h4>

In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span>, the core positioning includes three supporting elements: Government center, leading <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span> and the <span class="tourists-item">royal</span> residence. This are elements that <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the core positioning of the city and may be more <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> for one <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> group than for the other. <span class="ti-key-high">They are distinctive from many cities and give the city a particular character. Depending on <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> audience, the three supporting elements can also will be added to list of key features of The Hague.</span> They are explained below. 

<h4>Government center</h4>

The presence of government and ministries attract many <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span>, <span class="students-item">students</span> and congresses to the city. It is interesting for many parties to be ‘close to the decision-making centre’. The city is therefore also an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> location for lobbyists, consultancy firms, civil society organizations and NGOs. The accessibility of the national government is <span class="tourists-item">international</span>ly also <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>. Where else do you see ministers cycling, drinking a beer on a terrace and can you look almost literally in the office of the prime minister? It is in <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span>, <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> to have the government centre and all of the embassies located here instead of the capital city.

<h4>Leading <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span> </h4>

The Hague is a home to many leading <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span>from all over the world: from small to large, from established multinationals to innovative start-ups; from major attractions that are wide appealing to the public to small <span class="tourists-item">museums</span> that address a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> niche; from large <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> courts to small scientific <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span>; from a state of the <span class="tourists-item">art</span> convention center to one boutique hotel with <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> view. All these <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> put The Hague on the map and are an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> reason for <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> to settle here or visit the city. The diversity of <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> and the <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> collaborations that arise between them gives the city a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>, <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> dynamic. By these leading <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and appointing <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> strategically makes it possible to match the interests and expectations of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> group. For example, the leading <span class="tourists-item">museums</span> are <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> to <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span>. In front of <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> are renowned (inter) national head offices or clusters. 

<h4><span class="tourists-item">Royal</span> residence and allure</h4>

The Hague has been the <span class="tourists-item">royal</span> residence of <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span> since Willem I in 1813 The Netherlands. The fact that the king works here and will soon be living also gives the city extra cachet and makes the city even more <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> for many parties. <span class="ti-key-high">The <span class="tourists-item">royal</span> status underlines the stylish character and the high quality of facilities that the city has.</span> 

<h4>Pragmatic <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span></h4>

The elements of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague are leading in the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> for the various <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. <span class="ti-key-high">However, not all elements are equally <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> for all <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>.</span> That is why a pragmatic <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> has become a way to differentiate it per <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> group together, with the coalitions in the city developed, in text and image. The main features of the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> City bring these different categories through the recognitions as both the city of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span> and the City by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span>.  

<h4><span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> book The Hague</h4> 

The<span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague and all its different elements are recorded in a ‘<span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> book of the City of The Hague’. This is currently being developed together with the partners and will eventually take shape in a digital from. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book is not only adressed as a framework for the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> from The Hague, but also as an inspiring and <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span>-source toolkit with practical <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span>, such as writtings, facts, figures, photos and videos. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> book contains an image formula and a word mark for the city of The Hague with guidelines on how to use it. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book is not a static document, is systematically kept up to date. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book also provides a historical foundation for the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague, which describes how the city developed from the Middle Ages and how the unique elements and atmosphere of the city have emerged through different periods of the history.

<h4><span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> City of Example general message The Hague</h4>

The elements of the The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> determine the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague. They form a framework for <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span>. <span class="ti-key-high">The Hague consciously chooses to not to convert the elements into a slogan for the city. Such slogans for cities have little effect, evoke much discussion or sometimes even resistance.</span> The elements can be translated into a general text. Below is an example of one such text, which can be used as a general message in communicating about The Hague. This text is still a concept and is still being tested among the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. <i>In The Hague, tens of thousands of people work every day to make it safer and fairer world. <span class="ti-key-high">The Hague has been the place for <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> <span class="events-item">justice</span> for more than 100 years. People from all corners of the world come to the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> city of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">justice</span> to get along work on solutions to global problems. The Hague is both pleasant and personal. Everything is just steps away from each other.</span> The <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> is just around the corner. From the historic city center, just take the tram and in fifteen minutes you are on the eleven kilometer long <span class="tourists-item">beach</span> of The Hague. <span class="ti-key-high">The ideal place to get a breath of fresh air and get new ideas. The Hague has traditionally been an <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> city, with <span class="tourists-item">royal</span> allure.</span> This is where the <span class="tourists-item">Royal</span> family lives. It is the government center of the Netherlands, where <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> every day decisions about the future of the country take place. Many <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span>, <span class="students-item">students</span> and civil society organizations therefore consciously choose The Hague. <span class="ti-key-high">After all, here you can influence and make a difference in the world.</span> And only in The Hague can you just meet the king on the street, and here is where ministers, like everyone else, go on their bikes to work. <span class="ti-key-high">Prepare for the <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> encounters. Welcome to The Hague!</span></i>

<h3>3.Aspirations and goals </h3>
<h4> Aspirations </h4>

The aspiration has been expressed by this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> as a vision of The Hague in 2030 in <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span></span> areas where the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> could have a potential effect. The medium term used for the outlook shows that the with regard to city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> goes over a period that extends beyond the four-yearly cycles of the city council. Of course you can reason back to <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> for the shorter term ( Chapter 5 ), but ultimately <span class="young-prof-item">working</span> and developing the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> is a long time process. Based on the conversations between parties and collaborators we will be <span class="young-prof-item">working</span> towards succesfully implementing the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of The Hague.


<h4>Goal: <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span></h4>

<span class="ti-key-high">The <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> for The Hague as expressed above creates a number of challenges for The Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. Not only to promote the Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> together as a city in the coming years ( Chapter 8 ) to the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> ( Chapter 6 ) that we want to seduce to choose The Hague. It is also to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> of the city so that it is even more in line with The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span>. This <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> (<span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span>) is an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> part within the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague.</span> In recent years, a lot has been done to make The Hague a city where you want to be for one conference, a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> event, high-quality training, a career in one of The Hague top sectors or just to have an unforgettable experience. A lot of work has been done to make The Hague an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> city with great result, such as the Nuclear Security Summit, the Global Conference on CyberSpace, the location of the University’s Campus The Hague Leiden, the <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of the city center, the growth of The Hague Security Delta and various <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> sporting <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">events</span></span></span>. However, there is no time to rest. For the Brand The Hague will become even more visible and tangible in the capillaries of the city in the future we must continue. As a city, we must <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> up to <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> and ambitious initiatives that further increase the appeal of The Hague. The Hague is doing well, but it could be doing even <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span>. 

<h4>The Hague in 2030</h4> 

The Hague is flourishing. The city is alive and economically strong. This is largely due to the strong appeal to <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> <span class="events-item">organisations</span>, <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span>. The Hague is known worldwide as the meeting place for people <span class="young-prof-item">working</span> on a <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span> world. It is the most visited, most developed and highest rated coastal town of North West Europe. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> of The Hague is to a large extent determined by the <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="business-item">creatives</span></span></span> present in the city. More than anywhere in the world, the <span class="young-prof-item">younger</span> generation delivers in The Hague as an employee or entrepreneur a <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> to solutions for global challenges. As a government center, The Hague is the face of a modern democracy in a multicultural society. That and many other aspects make The Hague as one of the <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> places to settle. 

<h4><span class="young-prof-item"><span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span> City of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span></h4>

In the coming years, as a city, we will strive to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> our <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> as a city of <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span>. The world is full of conflicts arising from terrorism, migration, scarcity of raw materials and climate change. These conflicts have to happen in The Hague not only by being legally settled, but our city must also be the meeting place for it devising solutions for these complex <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> issues. In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span> to attracting many of <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> and institutes, places must be created where <span class="investors-item">institutions</span>, heads of government, scientists and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">entrepreneurs</span></span></span> can meet. The Hague has currently a number of <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> <span class="events-item">organisations</span> and renowned knowledge <span class="investors-item">institutions</span>. We are further investigating the possibility of creating a ‘meeting place’, that is a place for which <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span> come to specifically for to The Hague, and where a strong <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> is made to make <span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item">Peace</span></span> and <span class="events-item">Justice</span> in the city visible. 

<h4>City by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span></h4>

The location of The Hague by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> is an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> quality of our city, and not without reason one of the most <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> elements in the brand The Hague. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span> as an <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span> <span class="tourists-item">sea</span>side resort, The Hague <span class="tourists-item">beach</span>, can significantly <span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span> The Hague’s city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. A visit to <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span> must be a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> experience, even in winter. Initiatives that can make a strong <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> to this and <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the combination of the city and the <span class="tourists-item">beach</span> in The Hague therefore deserve more <span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span>. 

<h4>Leisure offer</h4>

With regard to a wide range of artistic, cultural <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="events-item"><span class="tourists-item"><span class="tourists-item">events</span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item">conferences</span></span> that fit the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague and those of national and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> level, it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> that we approach it with quality. It is <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span> to have a small and strong offer, than a wide one which has no <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> and clear <span class="ti-lang-strat">profile</span> of the city. This does not alter the fact that we do a lot at the urban level and at the district level in order to pursue a wider range in the city. We will be committed to host <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> exhibitions in our <span class="tourists-item">museums</span> and we will <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the <span class="tourists-item">royal</span> character of The Hague in the coming years. 

<h4>Crossovers</h4>
The Hague Security Delta joins the security cluster as a partnership of <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> on the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. Just as with The Hague Security Delta, it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> to also looking for crossovers between government for other economic sectors, knowledge <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> and <span class="investors-item">business</span>. This provides opportunities for small and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">entrepreneurs</span></span></span>. 

<h4>Image determiners</h4>
As a city we should not settle for rigidity, so in landmarked places in the city we should offer efficient spatial <span class="ti-lang-strat">developments</span>, but opt for <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span> urban planning, architecture and icons with <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> allure. Practice shows that ‘landmarks’ have the potential to bring the city to the top of

<h4>Offer <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> people</h4>
<span class="students-item">Students</span>, <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="business-item">creatives</span></span></span> influence city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> for The Hague. They are in fact an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> group. It is necessary to make the Hague more interesting for them in terms of the educational offer, which will continue to be <span class="ti-lang-strat">developed</span> with new programs that are appropriate for The Hague. In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span>, it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> to <span class="ti-lang-strat">develop</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> knowledge chains: cooperation between knowledge <span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item">institutions</span></span> and the <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">business</span></span> community, enabling innovation within the economic sectors in The Hague and promote the connection to the labor market for <span class="students-item">students</span>.


<h3> STRENGHTENING TASKS OF THE <span class="ti-lang-strat">BRAND</span> </h3> 
<h4> City <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> coalitions </h4> 
<p> Getting started by <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague for <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat"><span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> </span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> takes place within the coalitions based on actions that include <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> </p>

<h4>Township</h4>
<p>Ensures that <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span> programs (such as economic <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span>, internationally <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span>, education <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span> and event <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span>), projects and subsidies mirror The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague and help <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span>. It is further responsible for the strategic management of The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. it advises, monitors and stimulates <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span> topics, projects and decision-making within the municipality and beyond with regard to the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> aspect. </p>

<h3>4. The strategy</h3>
We <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague as a starting point for the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague. This <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> provides a number of other <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> strategic principles that are outlined below explained. 

<h4>Together as a city</h4>
<p>An essential starting point of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague is that it is a matter for the entire city. The city is made by everyone who has settled there. <span class="ti-key-high"> For a successful city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> that everyone collectively takes part and proudly promotes The Hague and provides a <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of the city. That is why this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>  was developed after extensive coordination with residents of The Hague and representatives of <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">entrepreneurs</span></span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">investor</span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and The Hague settings.</span> Not only to use their knowledge, but also because of their great importance and role in the implementation of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>. The <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> includes a strategy to share and promote the city of The Hague to show it in a <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span> way and make it even more <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> for the chosen <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>. An <span class="ti-lang-strat"><span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> </span> that focuses on the strength of residents of The Hague, <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">entrepreneurs</span></span></span>, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and to utilize <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> and fulfill a facilitating role as a municipality. Once everyone gets involved in this strategy more people will visit The Hague or opt for the city as a place of residence, residence and <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">business</span></span> location. In Chapter 7 <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span> is paid to how we can come together as a city, by adapting the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in order to strengthten and optimise the image of the city.  

<h4><span class="ti-lang-strat">Focus</span> on <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  </h4>
<p><span class="ti-key-high">City <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> means making choices for <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> where the <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> are primarily focused on such <span class="ti-lang-strat">targets</span> . This is the only way to achieve a coherent and effective <span class="ti-lang-strat">profile</span> of the city. </span>In Chapter 6 it is indicated what the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  are what is our <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on in this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> . In particular, we opt for this <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> people, <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">adults</span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> .</p>

<h4><span class="ti-lang-strat">Strengthen</span> and propagate</h4> 
<p><span class="ti-key-high">Ultimately, the mission of The Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> comes down to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> and propagating The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. Reinforcing it is about keeping the promise that is implied by The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. In other words, it is to ensure that the <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> of the city matches the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague.</span> Ideally, the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> message can be found in the deep structures of the city. In practice, however, it is often something that a city must continuously work on. Sometimes parts for the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> or <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  still have relatively much work to do. However, a city can grow according to a certian <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> stratedy and later expand within it. The challenges have already been explained in Chapter 2 that us to make the city more <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> with <span class="ti-lang-strat">targeted</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">developments</span> and investments in line with the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague. <span class="ti-lang-strat">Promoting</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague is about positively influencing the image of the city. This means that we must show The Hague to the outside world and to the elected <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="events-item">audiences</span> in a <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> way. Chapter 8 describes how we will do this together in the coming years. </p>

<h4>We are going to do what works </h4>
<p>Proven <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> techniques will be used to ensure the effectiveness of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague are used to measure the progress of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. Once again, the aim is to achieve <span class="ti-lang-strat">targeted</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> which will <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> The Hague. We will carry on surveys, discussion panels and <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  among the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> . In this way it can be determined whether the <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> (Chapter 5) achieved and the <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> lead to the desired <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span>. City <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> is often none matter of standard solutions with 100% guarantee on <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span>. It is often pioneering with creative concepts and initiatives. But by measuring the <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> of our adjustments we ensure that we actually do what works. </p>

<h4>Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Pride</span></h4>
<p><span class="ti-key-high">The Hague is special. There is a lot that we as a city can be proud of and that we can do ourselves with <span class="ti-lang-strat">profiling</span>. Fostering this <span class="ti-lang-tone">pride</span> and using it is an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> part within the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague. The Hagenaar plays an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> role in this. A proud Hagenaar is the <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> ambassador the city could wish for. </span>That is why the <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>  focuses on involving the residents of The Hague in the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of The Hague. Because of their <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>stories about the city and ensure that what is being done around The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthen</span> and propagate <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> not only outside the city limits, but also in one resonates positively in the city itself. </p>

<h4>Hague courage</h4>
<p>Courage is necessary to realise the <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span>. To where the Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> ultimately takes us is mainly driven by our imagination. We believe in this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> because the image of the city really resonates in us and see ourselves in the city. In all aspects of city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> and the components of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>  this daring echoes. Whether it is The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague, the <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> as formulated for the future, the way we work together or everything we do to make the Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> true. We challenge each other, inspire each other and are <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> to innovative ideas and initiatives. <span class="ti-key-high">We must dare to set the bar high and venture off the track, to think and act. That also means being <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> to initiatives that are more ambitious than anything we are used to. It is also <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> to consider the significance for investment and how these can impact the image of the city. </span></p>

<h3> 5. <span class="ti-lang-strat">Objectives</span> </h3>
<p>An essential part of the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague is that we measure whether we do what we do has the desired result. Not only to be <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> and transparent about our effectiveness, but also to fine-tune our <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>  and to transfer <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">develop</span> <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> until they do work. The action plans will contain <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> for each coalition which demonstrate a realistic and verifiable <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> to express and strenghten the Brand The Hague. In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span> to these <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span>, <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> and <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> are appointed. Set aside the <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> that are determined within the coalitions for <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  we <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on a national and <span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span> image <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> with regard to the main and supporting elements of The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. </p>

<h4>TASKS <span class="ti-lang-strat">OBJECTIVES</span> </h4>
<h4>City <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> coalitions</h4>
<p> • In action programs, define clear <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> for the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  group, where they are located, <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> and conduct research into the <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> achieved in order to be accountable and sharpen <span class="tourists-item">activities</span>. </p>
<h4> Township </h4> 
<p> • Conducts additional national and <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span> research into the image of The Hague relation to the main and supporting elements of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. </p>

<h3> 6. <span class="ti-lang-strat">Target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">Groups</span>  </h3>
<p> The <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  that we primarily <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on with the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague are made between sectors and individuals. <span class="ti-lang-strat">Specific</span> choices were made for this priority <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  and <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> areas based on an analysis. </p>

<h4> Sectors </h4>
<p> • <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">Companies</span></span>: especially in the clusters of safety, energy, connectivity (tech / IT), finance and legal and the creative sector (with <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span><span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span> to <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> innovative <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span>). 
• International <span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item">organisations</span></span>: in particular NGOs and <span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item">organisations</span></span> aimed at international relations and international law. 
• (Inter)-national congresses: suitable for the <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">business</span></span> meetings and Peace and Justice. 
• <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">Investors</span></span> and developers: (inter) national market parties that can play a role in the urban <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of The Hague. For the sectors, an <span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">international</span></span></span> perspective is predominantly used. <span class="ti-key-high">The various <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  are largely outside the Netherlands. This goes without saying for consequences for the various <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> in the context of the Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> towards this <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  are undertaken. </span></p>

<h4>Persons </h4>
<p> • Recreational and <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">business</span></span> <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span>: with <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span> to <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="business-item">creatives</span></span></span>. 
• <span class="students-item">Students</span>: especially (inter) national master <span class="students-item">students</span> and doctoral candidates. 
• Residents: in particular <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="business-item">creatives</span></span></span>. <span class="ti-key-high">The above shows a <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on talented <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> people and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">adults</span></span>. <span class="ti-key-high">This provides the possibility to arrive at a coherent message and <span class="ti-lang-strat">ambition</span> with regard to The Hague as an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> tourist destination, study city and residence for <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">adults</span></span>.</span> In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span>, it is a given that this group often still has an <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> attitude and is flexible in forming an image of a city and making choices. Not in the last place <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> people and <span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">adults</span></span> (<span class="young-prof-item">young</span> talent) exert an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> attraction for example <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and (inter) national <span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item">organisations</span></span>. The foregoing does not affect the other subgroups (such as expats) within the category of persons are relevant to the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague. </span> </p>

The analysis of the above aspects led to the choice of the described <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> . The chosen <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  score highly on the above aspects.

<h4>The Hague </h4>
<p> <span class="ti-key-high">The <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> is aimed at getting The Hague into the ‘mindset’ of the mentioned <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  (individuals and sectors) to ultimately increase the number of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  in the city.</span> Initially by attracting them from the outside as much as possible, however we acknowledge many of these <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> are already present in the city. The residents, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="students-item">students</span> already established in The Hague, play an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> role as ambassadors and role models by proudly telling about their city. The <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> that are undertaken within the framework of the Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> must be maximised have <span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span> from Hagenaars. </p>

<h3>7. Together as a city </h3>
<p> This <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>  can only succeed if there is a mutual responsibility and engagement from the city. We are therefore building on partnerships that have been established in the context of the City <span class="ti-lang-strat">Marketing</span> Vision 2011-2015 and will further expand into crucial partnerships that aim to jointly promote The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague. We together aim to improve our <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> towards <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> . An action plan will be drawn up for each partnership with <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> actions at the core. Partnerships will work together where possible and make use of each other’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span>. At the moment there are already coalitions for the following <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> : 

• <span class="students-item">Students</span>: The Hague <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> of higher and academic education, The Hague student union and ACKU Cultuurbureau are working together with the municipality on the <span class="ti-lang-strat">profiling</span> of The Hague as an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> student city. 
• Residents (<span class="young-prof-item">young</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="business-item">creatives</span></span></span>): Parties such as real estate agents, project developers, mortgage lenders, Young The Hague and DUWO are committed together with the municipality in The Hague as presenting it as an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> city (for living, working and living) and positioning for <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="business-item">creatives</span></span></span>. 
• <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">Companies</span></span>: The Hague New Center Foundation, the WestHolland Foreign Investment Agency (WFIA), The Hague Security Delta and other parties will join forces to <span class="ti-lang-strat">profile</span> The Hague as an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> city for establishing an <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">international</span></span></span></span></span> company. Part of this <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span> is that we join existing coalitions in <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span> to existing ones consultation structures for the following <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> : 
• Recreational <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span>: The aim is to make The Hague known as an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> city for especially <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> people and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> to visit. This is closely followed cooperated with the foundation The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Marketing</span> (implementing organization for the tourism <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span>) and its stakeholders. 
• <span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item"><span class="business-item">Conferences</span></span></span>: Just as for the <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  group of <span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">visitors</span></span></span>, it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> that the parties are present busy with congresses in our city come together to a stronger <span class="ti-lang-strat">profile</span> of The Hague as an <span class="ti-lang-tone">attractive</span> city for organizing <span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item"><span class="business-item">conferences</span></span></span>. The Convention Bureau Den The Hague plays an essential role in this. 
• <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span></span></span> organizations: The recently established The Hague <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">International</span></span></span></span> Network of Communicators (THinC), a network of communication and <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">professionals</span></span></span> from <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">International</span></span></span></span></span> organizations and <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> in The Hague, can play an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> role as coalition for <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span></span></span> organizations. THinC is affiliated with The Hague Peace and Justice project. 
• <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">Investors</span></span> and developers: It is obvious to connect for this <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  group with existing partnerships such as The Hague Nieuw Centrum foundation. To ensure that the coalition keeps in touch with the coalitions a consultative body and sounding board have been established. This platform consists of at least one representative per coalition and is supplemented by a number of experts. The input of residents is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span>, that is why the participants of this linked platform live in The Hague. The aim is to exchange ideas and to create cohesion between the various coalitions, <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  and <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span> areas. 

<span class="ti-key-high">The Hague City has an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> role to play in the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. They are the carriers of the story of The Hague and can <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> tell why based on their <span class="ti-lang-tone">pride</span> in The Hague others must also choose The Hague. These stories are also given a place in The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> Book The Hague. The coalitions work with representatives of the residents of The Hague, such as the Student union and <span class="young-prof-item">Young</span> from The Hague. In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span>, social media and <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  will become deployed to enter into a dialogue with the residents of The Hague, learn from them and become ambassador for the city.</span></p>

<h4>TASKS TOGETHER AS CITY </h4>
<h4>City <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> coalitions </h4>
<p>• Ensure optimal representation of stakeholders in the coalitions around it guarantee <span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span> and effectiveness. 
• Ensure that residents of The Hague are involved in city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. By their knowledge and to use experiences from / about The Hague and to enable them to tell the <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> story to tell the outside world about The Hague. </p>

<h4>Township </h4>
<p>• Provides substantive knowledge and expertise to (<span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span>) departments city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> coalitions and, like the other participants, contributes where possible financial <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> to implement the action programs. 
• Facilitates city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> coalitions. Fulfills the role of managing the process.
• Stimulates cooperation and synergy between the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> coalitions. </p>

<h3>8. Communicating the <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span></h3> 

<p><span class="ti-key-high">The basic principle for <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> the Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> is that we enter the city with confidence. We let people, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item">institutions</span> from the city explain why the city is so <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>to them. And we deploy <span class="ti-lang-strat">targeted</span>  communication campaigns around The Hague in a striking way, especially among the younger <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> . Research shows that a lot of<span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  do not know at all what The Hague has to offer and they often have a lot is more <span class="ti-lang-tone">positive</span> feeling about the city when they visit. </span> We will do everything we can to improve how our <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> get to know The Hague. Especially the unexpected sides of the city. The <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> for <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague are diverse. From websites to social media and from advertising to smart campaigns that give The Hague publicity. The promotion of The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> is done through the following three tracks: 
• General image improvement of the city. 
• <span class="ti-lang-strat">Targeted</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> made by the various partnerships. 
• <span class="ti-lang-strat">Profiling</span> through The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span>. </p>

<h4>General image enhancement of the city </h4>
<p>The previous analysis shows that the image of The Hague often does not match the <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> of the city, and the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> as it is defined. We will deploy various activities and <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span> to to tackle that: 

• We engage in an (inter)-national image campaign among <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> people and <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="business-item">adults</span></span></span> and how they experience the image of The Hague on several levels at the same time (such as studying, living, visiting and doing <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">business</span></span>). 
• <span class="ti-lang-strat">Support</span> in the <span class="ti-lang-strat">development</span> of an <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">international</span></span></span></span></span></span> media strategy for The Hague and facilitating an <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">international</span></span></span></span> media officers to actively engage with the <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">international</span></span></span></span> media <span class="ti-lang-strat">approach</span>.
• <span class="ti-lang-strat">Support</span> with the use of social media and the facilitation of a social media officers for the city of The Hague. This in particular aims to share the stories and experiences of residents, <span class="investors-item"><span class="business-item">companies</span></span> and <span class="investors-item">institutions</span>. 
• The use of (inter)-national films and films that fit the Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> TV productions by facilitating and providing producers of optimal services to provide. General image enhancement focuses on the main elements of The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span>. For these elements we will actively use <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> and <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span>. For the International City of Peace and Law, we will show even more strongly how we are working here for a <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span>, safe and just world and what effects it has in the world. A lot of good is happening in The Hague. Countless organizations are working here for a <span class="ti-lang-tone">better</span> world. And that work doesn’t just happen in courts and tribunals, but throughout the city where people are looking for innovative solutions to global social issues. When <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span>, we intend to <span class="ti-lang-strat">focus</span> on the aspect of creativity and innovation in the city. Additionally, we are doing everything possible to link the coast of The Hague and <span class="tourists-item">Scheveningen</span> to the rest of the city. </p>

<h4><span class="ti-lang-strat">Target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">group </span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> image enhancement </h4>
<p><span class="ti-key-high">Through partnerships, we will together promote The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague to <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span> . From each partner, an action plan will be made with <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="tourists-item">activities</span> that aim to enhance the image of The Hague among the <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">group </span></span>. Where possible, coalitions work together or use each other’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">resources</span>. </p>

<h4>

<p>The municipality subsidies and supports many <span class="tourists-item">activities</span>, <span class="investors-item">institutions</span>, <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">events</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item"><span class="business-item">conferences</span></span></span> from various <span class="ti-lang-strat">policy</span> programs (such as economy, culture and sport). Some of these initiatives contribute to the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague. The promoters will be asked to do so indicate in their project plan how they contribute to the <span class="ti-lang-strat">profile</span> of The Hague. The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">brand</span> book is an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> tool that is available to them. With the involved subsidy providers within the municipality will make agreements on how to do all this <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> to guarantee. </p>

<h4>The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span> </h4>
<p>A significant number of initiatives (such as <span class="tourists-item">activities</span>, <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="investors-item"><span class="events-item"><span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">events</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="investors-item"><span class="<span class="business-item"><span class="tourists-item">events</span></span>-item"><span class="business-item">conferences</span></span></span>) offer extraordinary opportunities for the (inter)-national <span class="ti-lang-strat">profiling</span> of The Hague, but require additional <span class="ti-lang-strat">support</span> that cannot reasonably be achieved only from the <span class="ti-lang-tone">relevant</span> promoters. We call these initiatives The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span>. They hold an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> place in the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> strategy. Recent examples of such Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span> are the reopening of the Mauritshuis, the World Cup Hockey, the World Cup Beach Volleyball, the Volvo Ocean Race, the Nuclear Security Summit and the Global Cyber Space Conference. Further in the past, the exhibition by Vermeer or the filming for the film Ocean’s Twelve. The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span> do not necessarily have to take place in the city. It can also be a <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>initiative that is organized outside the city and that The Hague offers a stage to the outside world to show. It is strongly not our intention to make The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span> subsidize in the context of The Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. <span class="ti-key-high">The strategy is aimed at supplementing the initiator’s <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span> to contribute to the <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> of the city or the bundling multiple initiatives within an overall <span class="ti-lang-strat">marketing</span> strategy. </span>The Hague <span class="ti-lang-tone">Highlights</span> for the coming years (further to be expanded) are the Just Peace Festival around International Day of Peace on September 21, the One Young World Summit in 2018 and possibly the European Beach Volleyball Championship in 2018. 

Conditions for an initiative to be classified as The Hague Highlight are: 
• It has to fit with The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague (especially in relation to the two main elements of The <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span> The Hague: International City of Peace and Justice and City by the <span class="tourists-item">sea</span> ). 
• It is aimed at two or more <span class="ti-lang-strat">target</span>  <span class="ti-lang-strat">groups</span>  (especially <span class="young-prof-item"><span class="students-item">young</span></span> people ). 
• It contributes to the (inter)-national <span class="ti-lang-strat">profiling</span> of the city. 
• It <span class="ti-lang-tone">highlights</span> the city on the map in an unexpected and exciting way. 
</p>

<h4>De Hagenaar as ambassador and role model </h4>

<p><span class="ti-key-high">The Hague has an <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> role to play in <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> The Hague <span class="ti-lang-strat">Brand</span>. De Hagenaar can <span class="ti-lang-tone">best</span> tell what makes our city <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>and why The Hague is so worthwhile to choose. Social media offers an excellent opportunity to share personal stories for The Hague residents, in which they tell with passion about their city to be choosen and brought to the <span class="ti-lang-strat">attention</span>.</span> In <span class="ti-lang-tone">addition</span>, there will also be a search for role models from The Hague, well-known residents of The Hague for their fame and the <span class="ti-lang-tone">special</span>bond with The Hague can be an example for others. Through giving these role models a stage they can inspire people and show what beautiful things The Hague has to offer.

<h3>9. Finance and evaluation</h3>
<h4>Finance</h4> 
<p>The municipal financial <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> to the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> in The Hague has been outlined. Various policies budget programs contribute directly or indirectly. There is a <span class="ti-lang-strat">specific</span> one annual <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> for city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of €1.6 million, which is included in the municipal budget (Program 11: Economy, International City and Inner City). The municipal financial <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> in the city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span> of The Hague is supplemented with contributions from parties from the city via partnerships. However, these contributions are of minor importance to the contributions they make through making time, energy, expertise available and, above all, applying their influence to the <span class="ti-lang-strat">Support</span> The Hague city <span class="ti-lang-strat">branding</span>. </p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p> Obviously, it is <span class="ti-lang-tone">important</span> to gain insight into the achievement of the <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> of the The Hague City Cranding and being <span class="ti-lang-tone">open</span> and transparent about it. That is why within partnerships we will formulate <span class="ti-lang-tone">concrete</span> <span class="ti-lang-strat">objectives</span> in the action plans that are drawn up. <span class="ti-key-high">These goals can relate to matters related to <span class="ti-lang-strat">strengthening</span> the brand The Hague as well as the <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> we want to achieve in <span class="ti-lang-strat">promoting</span> the brand. We will share our <span class="ti-lang-strat">contribution</span> to the Brand by defining and measuring the <span class="ti-lang-strat">identity</span> and image of the city in advance and how far we succeed in this. We are accountable and responsible for this and will use the <span class="ti-lang-strat">results</span> to sharpen our future <span class="ti-lang-strat">efforts</span>. </span></p>
